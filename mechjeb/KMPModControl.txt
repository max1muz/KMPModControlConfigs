#You can comment by starting a line with a #, these are ignored by the server.
#Commenting will NOT work unless the line STARTS with a #.
#Sections supported are md5, partslist, resource-blacklist and resource-whitelist.
#You cannot use both resource-blacklist AND resource-whitelist in the same file.
#resource-blacklist bans ONLY the files you specify whereas resource-whitelist bans ALL resources except those you specify.
#Each section has its own type of formatting. Examples have been given.
#Sections are defined as follows

!required

#Here you can define GameData (mod) folders that the client requires before joining the server
#[Folder]
#Example: MechJeb2

MechJeb2
Squad

#NOTE: This squad entry ensures that the client hasn't deleted the default parts. Disable this if undesired.

!md5

#To generate the md5 of a file you can use a utility such as this one: http://onlinemd5.com/
#For the MD5 section, file paths are read from inside GameData. If a client's MD5 does not match, they will not be permitted entry.
#You may not specify multiple MD5s for the same file. Do not put spaces around equals sign. Follow the example carefully.
#[File Path]=[MD5]
#Example: MechJeb2/Plugins/MechJeb2.dll=64E6E05C88F3466C63EDACD5CF8E5919

!resource-whitelist

#In this section you can specify the files to ban (or permit, if you change blacklist to whitelist).
#You do not need to specify a path, just a resource name.
#You can control any file from GameData here. It's prefered if you just specify the names of resources (as parts are controled by the partlist).
#[File]
#Example: MechJeb2.dll

!partslist

#This is a list of parts to allow users to put on their ships.
#If a part the client has doesn't appear on this list, they can still join the server but not use the part.
#The default stock parts have been added already for you.
#To add a mod part, add the name from the part's .cfg file. The name is the name from the PART{} section, where underscores are replaced with periods.
#[partname]
#Example: mumech.MJ2.Pod (NOTE: In the part.cfg this MechJeb2 pod is named mumech_MJ2_Pod. The _ have been replaced with .)
#You can use this application to generate partlists from a KSP installation if you want to add mod parts: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57284
